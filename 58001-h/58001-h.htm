<p>&ldquo;<i>And the three companies blew the trumpets</i>,

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the church of God,
in all ages past, as recorded in the Scriptures, is intended by
the Spirit to exhibit many things of vast importance to us, on
whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First</span>.&mdash;The rebellion,
ingratitude, and idolatry of the Israelites, give us an awful
proof of human depravity, and teach an humbling lesson to the
spiritual Israel, who have the same sinful nature, are prone to
the same sins, and would often fall into them and their
consequences, but for the grace of God.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Secondly</span>.&mdash;The patience and
long-suffering of God, particularly marked out in this
history&mdash;<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>he bare long with them; his mercy was extended,
prolonged, and manifested to them, notwithstanding all their
provocations, in forgetting his deliverances of them in times
past, and practising the same sins he had before resented.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thirdly</span>.&mdash;His disapprobation
of their conduct, and the means he took to testify it, are set
before us.&nbsp; Our God is never at a loss for means to
accomplish his wise and holy purposes of justice or mercy, as is
evident from the history before us.&nbsp; The blessed Spirit
operating upon the souls of his people, often by his influence
reproves their consciences of sin, as it is so opposite to the
purity of that divine nature, or holy principle he has blessed
them with.&nbsp; Sin, committed by a believer, is a transgression
of the law, or dictates of faith; for there is no sin, condemned
under the first covenant, but what, under the covenant of grace,
is pointed out in more odious colours.&mdash;Hence the idolatry,
rebellion, and ingratitude of the believer, are seen and lamented
by him as a child of God; and as God the Spirit communicates
light to his understanding, to discover it as sinful, he
perpetually testifies that his sins are more sinful than those
who know not God.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fourthly</span>.&mdash;The inseparable
connection between sin and sorrow, is felt by all, both elect and
non-elect.&nbsp; By nations, families, and individuals, <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the moral and
penal evils of the Fall, will be, must be, and are felt by
all.&nbsp; The non-elect feel it in many awful forms, as
transgressors, in the curse of the ground, in the calamities of
war, in all the dreadful horrors of a guilty conscience, and in
the wrath of a sin-avenging God.&nbsp; Nations feel it
universally; this is evident by the calamities which befell the
land of Canaan&mdash;so the 6th Chapter begins: &ldquo;And the
children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord; and the
Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their
sin was resented in this form, by the Lord&mdash;the prevailing
of their enemies, which forced them to hide in dens, caves,
mountains, and strong holds&mdash;their enemies destroyed the
increase of their country, and reduced them almost to a famine;
&ldquo;and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the
Midianites&rdquo; and people of Arabia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fifthly</span>.&mdash;The tender mercy of
God the Saviour appears as remarkable in their deliverance; in
the remembrance of his covenant of old, with their fore-fathers;
his good hand was seen in bringing them out of trouble, although
they had brought these troubles on themselves&mdash;what a
solemn, but gracious proof; &ldquo;O!&nbsp; Israel, thou hast
destroyed thyself! but in me is thine help.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what
encouragement does this give to poor backsliders to return to
Jesus, their first husband; <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>for although they have brought these
troubles on themselves, yet Jesus is ready to deliver them!&nbsp;
What a striking account does the pious Nehemiah give of the
conduct of the Israelites, and the goodness of God to
man&mdash;9th chap. 28th verse; &ldquo;But after they had rest,
they did evil again before thee, therefore thou leftest them in
the hands of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them;
yet when they cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven; and
many times thou didst deliver them, according to thy tender
mercies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sixthly</span>.&mdash;I remark again, that
our God has ever manifested himself a God, hearing prayer: the
children of Israel cried unto the Lord, and the Lord sent a
prophet to them; and after reproving them, we have an account of
a deliverer, raised up by the Lord himself.&nbsp; What
encouragement does this give to us in all our trials, without and
within, whether in body, soul, circumstances, family, or
nation.&nbsp; God has even condescended to hear the cries of many
who had no grace, yet, led by the light of nature to call on him
in trouble; and will he turn a deaf ear to his saints in trouble?
surely not.&nbsp; Believer, the remedy&rsquo;s before
thee&mdash;<span class="GutSmall">PRAY</span>.</p>
<p>In taking one more view of this history, we must admire the
conduct of God in over-turning all the schemes of men, their
wisdom, counsel, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>and power: that in providence as well as in grace, his
wisdom, power, and faithfulness, might be clearly seen and adored
by his people.&nbsp; His wisdom in the permission of the Fall,
and its awful consequences, seems to go before, and make way for
the displays of his love, mercy, power, and faithfulness.&nbsp;
This is seen in his dispensations, generally, and particularly in
grace &amp; providence.&nbsp; How often has infinite wisdom
permitted heavy troubles to come on the Church, to wean her from
the creature&mdash;to shew her the value of Jesus, as a
deliverer&mdash;and to lead her to him by many intreaties; that
while we feel our strength perfect weakness, we may the more
clearly discover the good hand of our God, in our support and
deliverance, and give him the glory due to his name for it.&nbsp;
The principal end God has in view in all his dispensations, is
his own glory&mdash;this is the first cause and last grand end of
all things&mdash;&ldquo;for of him, and through him, and to him,
are all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had the victory we are considering
been gained by well disciplined men, led on by wise, noble,
valiant generals, who had often been successful in war&mdash;had
this been the case, the creature would have been extolled, and
God nearly forgotten.&nbsp; But this victory was a display of the
power of Jehovah&mdash;his hand clearly seen, his mercy
displayed, and all the honor given to him to whom it is
due.&nbsp; The means, the feeble means the Lord made use of were
simply, a weak <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>un-armed man, with only three hundred men, led by him,
with lamps, trumpets, and pitchers&mdash;to carnal reason a very
unlikely method to conquer two hundred thousand Midianites, well
skilled in the art of war.&nbsp; But this was God&rsquo;s method,
and we have a right to submit our wisdom to God&rsquo;s plan;
&ldquo;for my thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor my ways as
your ways, saith the Lord; for as the heavens are high above the
earth, so are my ways above your ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this
victory, through such feeble means, is a confirmation of this
truth&mdash;the angel Jehovah Jesus, appeared to Gideon as he was
threshing wheat, in a secret place, to hide it from the enemy;
and assured him, that however mean himself and family were, he
should deliver Israel from their present servitude.&nbsp; Gideon,
astonished at such an appearance, such a salutation, and such a
declaration, began to ask, &ldquo;How this could be?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The blessed Jesus tells him, &ldquo;Surely I will be with
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gideon, like the rest of God&rsquo;s people,
could not give God the credit of God, nor take him at his
word&mdash;he could not honor him by believing on him, and prays,
&ldquo;If I have found grace in thy sight, shew me a sign that
thou talkest with me.&rdquo;&mdash;As believers in Jesus, we are
called to walk by faith, and not by sight, as seeing him who is
invisible, or out of sight&mdash;depending on his word, oath, and
faithfulness, as the word of a covenant God, who cannot lie: this
is honoring Jesus&mdash;yet God condescended <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>to give Gideon
the request of his lips; and to confirm his faith, he, with a
rod, touched the rock, and caused fire to come out of it, and,
consume the slain Kid and unleavened cakes, all moistened with
the broth, which Gideon, at his command, had put thereon.&nbsp;
Gideon was fearful and apprehensive of immediate death, as he had
seen an angel; but the Lord kindly assured him that he was in no
danger.&mdash;How strange and groundless the fears of God&rsquo;s
people&mdash;frequently they take covenant-love dispensations as
tokens of wrath; forgetting it is written, &ldquo;I will no more
be wroth with thee, nor forsake thee.&rdquo;&mdash;We are seldom
satisfied with the wise and gracious conduct of our God; when we
have no sign or clear evidences we murmur&mdash;when we have we
often fear they are not of a right kind.&nbsp; Well may saints be
called children, seeing they possess the weakness of them.</p>
<p>After this, Gideon built an altar, and called it Jehovah
Shalom&mdash;believing what the Lord had declared, &ldquo;that he
would send peace to Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is worthy of
observation, that the people of God only rear up altars to the
Lord, as they believe in him&mdash;there is no praying or
praising but by faith in Jesus; this leads the soul out to God,
and &ldquo;without faith it is impossible to please
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gideon then testified his zeal for the service
of God, and in God&rsquo;s strength he threw <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>down the altar
of Baal, and cut down the grove that was by it.&nbsp; This shews
the effect of faith in Jesus; it is a faith which worketh by love
to God&rsquo;s service, and produces a zeal for his glory.&nbsp;
This alarms Satan, who stirs up persecution against all who love
the Redeemer&rsquo;s cause, as in the instance of
Gideon&mdash;his fellow-citizens sought his life, for opposing
their idolatry; but Joash, his father, remonstrated with them,
that it did not become the people of God to plead for Baal; and
that if Baal was truly God, he ought to exert his power in
punishing those who had broken down his altar; and he called his
son Jerubbaal, that is, let Baal contend with himself (if he
can).</p>
<p>Understanding the Midianites had crossed Jordan, Westward, and
were encamped in the valley of Jezreel, at no great
distance&mdash;filled with the Spirit of God, as a spirit of
courage, Gideon sounded a trumpet, and assembled his friends, to
the number of thirty-two thousand men.&nbsp; But, alas! what was
this little army to meet and encounter with two hundred
thousand!&nbsp; Perhaps his heart might fail him once
more&mdash;he begs another, even a double sign.&nbsp; We must
never forget that God has said &ldquo;Open thy mouth wide; ask
great things;&rdquo;&mdash;the Lord graciously answers him, and
by bedewing a fleece of wool, while the adjacent ground was
dry&mdash;and again bedewing the ground, while the fleece of wool
was dry, the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Lord confirmed his doubtful mind.&nbsp; Thus assured of
victory Gideon marched his forces directly towards the
Midianites.&nbsp; What the army thought we know not, in their
march, knowing their fewness and the vast army of the
other&mdash;but every natural gift is of the Holy-Ghost, as the
God of nature and providence, as well as every spiritual one; and
all the wisdom and courage of warriors are the work of God the
Spirit, and no man has any of these gifts inherent in himself,
they are the peculiar gifts of God, to answer his holy
purposes.&nbsp; And now Gideon&rsquo;s faith is put to a double
trial.&nbsp; If God gives his people grace, he tries that grace,
especially the grace of faith.&nbsp; At the well of Harod God
ordered him to warn his army, that every one who was timorous
should return home, and there returned home twenty-two thousand!
so that Gideon was left but with ten thousand.&nbsp; God was
wisely securing the honor of this victory to himself&mdash;hence
he assigns this reason, &ldquo;lest Israel vaunt themselves and
say, Not the Lord, but mine hand hath done this:&rdquo; and so it
is in our salvation&mdash;God has wisely permitted man to become
as weak as he was wicked, that he might take occasion to honor
the riches of his grace, in saving those who could not save
themselves: and how often is this seen in his providential
dealings, when brought into circumstances of sore trial, and
every door shut up? then it is that the Lord&rsquo;s hand is more
clearly <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>seen, and the glory redounds to him.&nbsp; His glory is
great in our salvation&mdash;this made the ancients say,
&ldquo;When the bricks are doubled, then comes Moses;&rdquo; that
is, &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s greatest extremity is God&rsquo;s
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gideon&rsquo;s faith is tried again: &ldquo;The people are yet
too many for me,&rdquo; saith the Lord.&mdash;He was then ordered
to cause all of his people to drink out of the river, without
using any vessel.&nbsp; On this trial only three hundred lapped
the water, putting their hands to their mouths; the rest bowed on
their knees to drink water.&nbsp; This was emblematic of their
spirits and minds&mdash;some, apparently careless of their
country, took their ease at the water-side&mdash;the three
hundred, set upon the battle, (which they saw God&rsquo;s hand
was in), they only lapped the little out of their hands they had
hastily caught up.&nbsp; What an emblem of the different
characters that compose the visible church of Jesus&mdash;some
who only have a name to live, and are dead! who are taking their
ease in Zion, and resting beside the waters of creature comforts;
while the humble and zealous believer is using the world as a
traveller at an Inn, knowing that he is but a stranger and a
pilgrim here below; and that as he is engaged in a warfare, it
will not be for God&rsquo;s glory to load himself with thick
clay.&nbsp; The Lord then says, &ldquo;By the three hundred men
that lapped will I save Israel.&rdquo;&mdash;<a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>These three
hundred were ordered to provide victuals for some days; and each
a trumpet, a lamp, and a pitcher.&nbsp; We hear nothing of arms;
but, just before the victory, Gideon and Phurah his servant, went
into the Midianitish camp, at night, as directed of God.&nbsp;
Here, for the confirmation of his faith, and once more, to assure
him of success, he heard a soldier in the host tell his comrade
of a strange dream he had, of a barley cake rolling from the
hill, and over-turning his tent.&nbsp; The other explained the
dream, and said, &ldquo;This is no other than the Sword of
Gideon, the son of Joash, a man of Israel, for into his hand hath
God delivered the Midianites.&rdquo;&mdash;Doubtless the
Midianites had heard before that the God of Israel had raised up
one to oppose them; but they were not intimidated with that,
perhaps only laughed at the weakness of the Israelites, in
placing any dependence on their God&mdash;as Satan and the world,
pharisees, and hypocrites, laughing at believers, walking by
faith, and not by sight; it will be the believer&rsquo;s turn to
laugh another day, when their enemies shall gnaw their tongues in
anguish, and say, We fools counted their lives madness, and their
end without honor.</p>
<p>Gideon was now encouraged, divided his army into three
companies, and ordered them to imitate him in all he
did&mdash;16th verse; &ldquo;And he divided the three hundred
into companies,&rdquo; one <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>hundred in each company, partly to
make the better figure; a shew of an army, with right and left
wing, and partly that they might fall upon the camp of Midian in
different parts&mdash;and he put a trumpet in every man&rsquo;s
hand&mdash;they that returned of the trumpeters having left their
trumpets behind, so that there was a sufficient number of
trumpets for three hundred men; and these were put into their
hands, that when they blew together the noise would be very
great, and it would seem, by the noise, like a great army, and so
terrify their enemies.&nbsp; &ldquo;With empty pitchers, and
lamps within the pitchers:&rdquo; the pitchers were of earth, and
so very easily broken, and made a great noise in clashing
together one against another; and these were empty of water, or
otherwise would not have been fit to put lamps into&mdash;and the
lamps put into them were not of oil, for then when the pitchers
were broken the oil would have run out&mdash;but were a kind of
torches, made of rosin, wax, pitch, and such like things; and
these were put in the pitchers to preserve them from the wind,
and conceal them from the enemy till just as they came upon them,
and then they held them out&mdash;which, in a dark night, would
make a terrible blaze, as before this they were of use to light
them down the hill to the camp.&nbsp; Gideon stood forward first,
and as he acted so were they to act; and as they were acting so
they were to exclaim, &ldquo;The Sword of the Lord <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and of
Gideon!&rdquo; or, for the Lord and for Gideon.&nbsp; The name
Jehovah, these heathens might often have heard as the God of
Israel, and would now sound dreadful to them; and the name of
Gideon also:&mdash;this was the reason why Gideon is added, and
not out of arrogance and vanity, but put after the name of the
Lord, as being only an instrument the Lord thought fit to make
use of; but all the glory belonged to the Lord.</p>
<p>Verse 19.&mdash;So Gideon, and the three hundred men that were
with him, which was one of the three companies his army was
divided into, came unto the out-side of the camp, in the
beginning of the middle watch, (the second watch).&nbsp; In early
times the Jews divided their nights into three watches; Gideon
choose the middle&mdash;had he come the first, all might not have
been in bed&mdash;had he come the last, some might have been
rising; but he took this time, a little after midnight in the
dead of the night, when the whole army was fast asleep&mdash;and
the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers,
and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their
right hands, to blow withal&mdash;and they cried, The Sword of
the Lord, and of Gideon!&nbsp; The noise, and the blaze of light
were very surprising to the host of Midian, just awaking out of
their sleep, perhaps&mdash;an awful emblem of the surprise <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>a soul
experiences, when it leaves the body without a hope, and without
a God!&mdash;a greater emblem of that period, when the midnight
cry shall be made&mdash;when the arch-angels trumpet shall wake
the dead!&mdash;shake the vast creation when the blaze of a
burning world, and the sword of vindictive justice shall be
seen.&mdash;&ldquo;The host of Midian ran, and cried, and
fled.&rdquo;&mdash;Such shall the terror be in that dread
moment.&nbsp; See this finely represented by the excellent
Admiral Kempenfelt, who was drowned in the Royal George, and who
composed some excellent verses on the Last Day.&nbsp; I will only
mention these two verses, as suitable to this subject, and will
be acceptable to the believer, while it is a terror to those
Midianites who will experience the horrors of that
day.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hark! &rsquo;tis the trump of God<br />
Sounds thro&rsquo; the worlds abroad&mdash;<br />

<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>But
while the Midianites fled, the Israelites stood every man in his
place;&mdash;so it will be at the final consummation of all
things.&nbsp; Clothed in the righteousness of Jesus, we shall
stand in our lot, and see a burning world, and the misery of the
damned.&nbsp; But while Jesus descends as our salvation we shall
glorify, and for ever admire him.&mdash;This will surely be thy
experience and thy privilege, O believer, as sure as ever the
Holy Spirit has brought you, in time, to believe on him, to seek
him, rejoice in him, and live to his praise.</p>
<p>To close the history of Gideon&mdash;we find, that the
Midianites in the dark, and in their terror, took their friends
for their foes, and killed one another&mdash;one hundred and
twenty thousand Midianites were slain; fifteen thousand got over
Jordan with Zebah and Zalmunna, their kings.&mdash;Gideon pursued
them at their heels.&nbsp; His men being faint he desired the
elders of Penuel and Succoth, as he passed, to give them
victuals; but they, accounting him a fool to pursue such an army
with such an handful of men, refused his troops refreshment,
which he, afterwards, justly resented.&mdash;After his victories
the Israelites offered him the government of their country, which
he as piously declined, and told them the Lord, alone, was their
rightful sovereign.&mdash;Thus was Midian conquered in such a
manner that they <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>lifted up their heads no more, to threaten or overcome
the Israelites.&mdash;After judging Israel seventy years, Gideon
dies, leaving behind him seventy sons, all of whom were basely
murdered by Abimelech.</p>
<p>We cannot close this history of pious, valiant, honored
Gideon, without taking a view of the grand design of God the Holy
Ghost, in this, as well as in many more instances of renowned
warriors, pious judges, and noble deliverers.&mdash;I humbly
conceive in the history of Gideon is sweetly exhibited the
adorable Redeemer, as the Christ of God, as the Deliverer of his
saints, as the Saviour of sinners, as the Judge of Israel, and
the glorious leader of his people.&nbsp; His poverty and
meanness, set forth the abasement and humiliation of him who was
rich, yet, for our sakes, became poor, in every sense of the
word.&nbsp; Gideon&rsquo;s call to his work, sets forth
Christ&rsquo;s call to save sinners, which he willingly accepted
for the sake of his Israel.&nbsp; Hence the Father, in the
Covenant, is represented as saying, &ldquo;I have called thee in
righteousness; thou art my servant, in whom I will be
glorified.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the Redeemer says, &ldquo;Now the Lord
God, and his Spirit hath sent me&mdash;the Spirit of the Lord is
upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the
Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The miraculous confirmation of
Gideon&rsquo;s call, leads us to remark the miracles of our
blessed Jesus, as <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>proofs of his Divinity, and to confirm his Messiahship
as the sent of the Father; not forgetting the Father&rsquo;s
testimony at his baptism and transfiguration.&nbsp; The zeal
Gideon shewed for the service of God, reminds us of him who once
said, &ldquo;The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up;&rdquo; and
who drove the buyers and sellers out of his Father&rsquo;s
house.&mdash;By a few weak, unarmed men, Gideon did
wonders.&nbsp; What a type of him who, by a few poor illiterate
preachers, sounding the Gospel trumpet, and displaying the light
and fire from their earthen vessels, foiled sin and Satan, and
the lying and delusive systems of Scribes, Pharisees, and
idolatrous Priests, in the Jewish and Gentile world.&mdash;As
Gideon invited others to share in his victories, so does our
glorious Immanuel, Christ; having obtained peace by the blood of
his cross, and wrought out a complete obedience, he invites his
friends, and bids them an hearty welcome, with an &ldquo;Eat, O
friends.&rdquo;&mdash;Gideon mildly pacified the unreasonable
Ephraimites&mdash;and how mildly does our Jesus often pacify our
rebellious spirits, when he overcomes us with sweet discoveries
of his covenant love, tender mercy, covenant faithfulness, and
finished work.&mdash;Gideon resented the cruelty of the men of
Penuel, for refusing his men refreshment&mdash;he, tore flesh,
killed their chief men, and destroyed their tower&mdash;a
striking emblem how Christ will deal with mystical Babylon, and
with all who <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>deny his poor people help in time of need&mdash;(see the
25th Matthew) &ldquo;When I was hungry ye gave me no
meat&mdash;and these shall go away into everlasting punishment,
but the righteous into life eternal.&rdquo;&mdash;After his
victories he arrives to great honor; and our Jesus is highly
exalted.&nbsp; Gideon judges Israel; and all judgment is
committed to Jesus.&mdash;Gideon asks a present of those for whom
he had done so much; and Jesus says, &ldquo;My son, give me thine
heart!&rdquo;&mdash;and by Paul, &ldquo;I beseech you by the
mercies you have received, to dedicate yourselves to God, which
is your reasonable service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot pass by this history without enlarging a little more,
which I shall do, God leading me, only to make a few remarks, in
a spiritual way, upon that part which I first read as a text; and
I hope, without any injustice to the subject, or straining it, or
putting a sense on it, that was never intended, there can be no
impropriety in my leading the minds of my hearers from the lesser
to a greater subject; and I must give it as my most decided
opinion, that the greatest part of the Old Testament
circumstances were really designed to hold forth something of
Jesus, and the salvation of the Gospel.&nbsp; To exhibit from the
text the Person and Work of the Son of God&mdash;to point out the
qualifications and work of Gospel ministers, with an application
of the text to <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>the whole body of God&rsquo;s elect, in the present
state of things, is my design.&nbsp; The Person of Jesus, as
God-Man Mediator, and the Redemption of men, by him, was
exhibited to the Old Testament saints, by many figures; these,
the excellent Milton stiles Religious Rights of Sacrifices;
informing men, by types and shadows, of that destined Seed to
bruise the Serpent&mdash;by what means he shall atchieve
deliverance.&mdash;Our blessed Lord owns many of the shadows: the
Apostle, or rather the Holy-Ghost by the Apostle, applies many
others; the Brazen Serpent, Solomon&rsquo;s Temple, the Prophet
Jonah in the Whale&rsquo;s belly, the Smitten Rock, the Vail of
the Temple, the divided Waves of the Sea, the Cloud by Day and
the Pillar of Fire by Night, with a vast many other
emblems.&nbsp; Nor can I see why our blessed Jesus should not be
pointed out to the faith and hope of God&rsquo;s saints, by the
lamp and pitcher, while he, at the same time sounded the trumpet
of free grace and eternal mercy, which was &ldquo;a savour of
life unto some, and of death unto others.&rdquo;&nbsp; May not
the pitcher be an emblem of his earthen nature, and the lamp
within, of his divinity&mdash;and by virtue of union of the two
natures, our God is manifest in the flesh&mdash;married our
nature, conferred an honor upon poor sinners that he never
conferred on the angels.&nbsp; This was Job&rsquo;s triumph,
&ldquo;in my flesh shall I see God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took part of
the children&rsquo;s flesh and blood; <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>he was truly human&mdash;bone of our
bone and flesh of our flesh.&nbsp; God sent forth his Son, made
of a woman, without the intervention of a human father, but by
the miraculous impregnation of the Holy-Ghost; so that his human
nature appears to be the joint work of the Trinity&mdash;the
Father provides it&mdash;&ldquo;a body hast thou prepared
me,&rdquo;&mdash;the Son assumed it&mdash;&ldquo;he took on him
the form of a servant;&rdquo;&mdash;the Spirit formed
it&mdash;&ldquo;that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall
be called the Son of God&mdash;thus the word was made flesh and
dwelt among us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lamp within the pitcher may be
an emblem of his Godhead, as the light of life&mdash;he wrapped
up his divinity in his manhood&mdash;here it was he concealed his
glory: well may the Prophet exclaim, &ldquo;Verily thou art a God
that hidest thyself, O God of Israel the Saviour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What a mystery! a child born&mdash;&ldquo;the everlasting Father,
the mighty God.&rdquo;&nbsp; How great is the mystery of
godliness!&nbsp; Angels are amazed, saints admire, and sinners
triumph&mdash;a God in every perfection, a Man in every
faculty&mdash;God-Man&mdash;the f&oelig;deral head&mdash;the
representative of his Church&mdash;the second Adam&mdash;a public
person&mdash;that as Adam the first, was the head of all, as
sinners, so Jesus should be the head of all his elect.&nbsp; How
striking is the language of Milton, when he represents the
Almighty Father thus addressing his eternal Son&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Be thou, in Adam&rsquo;s room, the head of all
mankind,<br />
Tho&rsquo; Adam&rsquo;s son; as in him perish all men,<br />
So, in thee, as from a second root shall be restor&rsquo;d<br />
As many as are restor&rsquo;d&mdash;without thee none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This divinity often blazed through his humanity, in the
miracles he wrought, which were done by his own eternal power and
Godhead&mdash;the words he spoke, the tidings he foretold, but
particularly his transfiguration on the Mount, when the light of
his divinity shone so luminous, that his whole body, and even his
raiment appeared like the sun in a case of chrystal.&nbsp; Peter
calls it an excellent glory&mdash;St. John says we beheld his
glory&mdash;the Evangelists say of those with him on Mount
Tabor&mdash;and when they were awake, they saw his glory.&nbsp;
The lamp may be a fine emblem of Jesus, as the light of life;
this is peculiar to him as God, and as God-Man.&nbsp; The light
is the most striking emblem of God Jesus; it is the life and
beauty of every thing else&mdash;it hath a kind of omnipotency in
it&mdash;a peculiar brightness and purity.&nbsp; He is the light
of reason to all&mdash;he is the light of grace in the
covenant&mdash;the light of truth in the word&mdash;the light of
life in the souls of the elect, and the light of heaven in
glory&mdash;the Lamb is the light thereof; the Lord is thine
everlasting light, and thy God thy glory: this is the lamp of
salvation, the light of the Gentiles and the glory of his true
Israel&mdash;such Jesus is, and such his grace.&nbsp; O! may he
shine on you!&mdash;this <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>will engage your hearts to love,
admire, adore, and praise his name for ever and ever.&mdash;As
all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Jesus, so all the
blessings of an everlasting covenant is treasured up in
him&mdash;all that we can possibly stand in need of, for time and
eternity&mdash;blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
places in Christ Jesus; for God giveth not the Spirit by measure
to him&mdash;all the fulness of blessings are in him, for his
dear people&rsquo;s use; hence, says one, &ldquo;Out of his
fulness have we all received, and grace for grace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These gifts could only flow to us through his obedience and
death&mdash;the gift of the Spirit&mdash;access to
God&mdash;spiritual knowledge and eternal glory.&nbsp; Not that
the Redeemer is to be considered as purchasing these blessings;
they were all given as the free, unmerited gift, of God&mdash;but
it was necessary that Jesus should obey and suffer, that these
gifts should flow to us in a way of justice and holiness, while
the mercy and compassion of God was displayed.&nbsp; Hence he
says, &ldquo;If I go not away the Comforter will not come unto
you; but if I depart I will send him unto you&mdash;it is
therefore expedient for you that I go away;&rdquo; as it was
necessary that the pitchers should be broken, that the blaze of
light might appear&mdash;First, to overturn the enemies of
Israel&mdash;Secondly, to deliver the people from their
oppression&mdash;so, by the sufferings and death of the human
nature of Christ, he overturned the kingdom of <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Satan, took
away his power, and delivered his people from the law, the guilt
of sin, and the powers of darkness&mdash;he, by his death, slew
death, and him who had the power of death; and who hoped he
should be the executioner of the penal sentence of the law, was
disappointed&mdash;in seeing the great Deliverance that was
brought about in such a wonderful way, he was foiled and spoiled,
the curse of the law falling on Christ&mdash;enduring the curse
which we had deserved&mdash;standing in our place, he fulfilled
the law for us, by his holy life&mdash;made an atonement by his
awful, though glorious death&mdash;sanctified the grave by his
burial&mdash;and rose for the justification of all that believe
in him.&nbsp; Here was the overcoming the sharpness of death, and
the opening the kingdom of heaven to all believers; and upon his
ascension to heaven, and sitting on the right hand of the Father,
he obtained the gift of the Holy-Ghost, which was shed abroad on
the Apostles; and all spiritual good for poor sinners.&nbsp;
Thus, through the breaking the earthen pitcher, a light is made
manifest; all covenant blessings flow to us, in a way honorable
to God, and safe to man&mdash;and now we rejoice, that by him all
that believe are justified from all things; and that the blood of
Jesus cleanseth us from all sin.&nbsp; But can we forget the
trumpet of his voice of love and mercy, which he so often sounded
during his public ministry?&nbsp; With what declarations of <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>blessedness
did he begin his sermon on the Mount&mdash;what sweet invitations
did he give to poor condemned, sin-burthened souls, in these
words, &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden.&mdash;If any man thirst, let him come unto me and
drink.&mdash;Behold the man&mdash;look unto me&mdash;Come ye to
the waters.&mdash;All things are ready, come unto the
marriage.&mdash;Behold the Lamb of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the
inviting voice of the trumpet of the Gospel, as preached by the
Lord Jesus&mdash;and though so melodious to a poor sinner; what
solemn awful sounds were sometimes heard from his gracious and
holy lips!&mdash;and how great the truth afterwards declared,
that the ministry of Jesus is a savour of life unto life, or of
death unto death.&nbsp; Hence, he said, &ldquo;Wo unto you,
Scribes, Pharisees, Hypocrites!&nbsp; Except your righteousness
exceed the Pharisees, ye cannot be saved!&mdash;Except you
repent, you shall likewise perish!&mdash;and because you say, we
see, your sin remaineth.&mdash;For judgment am I come into this
world, that those who see not might see; and those who boast of
their light might be made blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The victory, of Gideon was a display of the sublime
perfections of Deity; and surely we see them more clear, and more
glorified in the work of a sinner&rsquo;s salvation: eternal love
is the spring&mdash;infinite wisdom lays the plan&mdash;almighty
power <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>executes it&mdash;while mercy, grace, and compassion,
justice and holiness, sovereignty and truth, appear
glorious.&nbsp; Yes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Here the whole Deity is known,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor dares a creature guess<br />
Which of the Glories brightest shone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Justice or the Grace!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly.&mdash;May not the pitcher, lamp, and trumpet, be an
emblem of Gospel ministers, and their office in the Church of
Jesus Christ?&nbsp; We have this treasure in earthen
vessels&mdash;the Gospel is a treasure, because it exhibits the
riches of God and of Christ, in mercy, love, grace, wisdom, and
power; which are unsearchable, substantial, and
satisfying&mdash;the repository, cabinet, or pitcher in which
this treasure is, are earthen vessels.&nbsp; Most Divines are of
opinion that the Apostle refers to the circumstance we are
considering.&nbsp; It is our mercy the Gospel is put into such
vessels&mdash;an Angel, commissioned from the high throne of God,
however lofty his language, however kind his message, yet would
not be a proper person to preach to the Church of
God&mdash;Ministers must be men of like passions with the Church;
have the same depraved nature; be taught by the same Spirit; have
the same trials in body, soul, and circumstances; or how could
they sympathize with the Church?&nbsp; Now, that all the
excellency of the power of the word might <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>be of the
Holy-Ghost, (which is the grand design of God) he has kindly put
this treasure of the Gospel in earthen vessels, brittle shells,
baked earth&mdash;to shew the frailty of the bodies of the best
of men&mdash;&ldquo;Your fathers! where are they?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Do the Prophets live for ever?&rdquo;&nbsp; This is to
shew the outward meanness of those instruments the Lord makes use
of; but few rich, honorable, or noble, are called to the work;
and frequently the most useful have been poor illiterate common
mechanics.&nbsp; God is determined to stain the pride of human
glory&mdash;to this end he has chosen the base, the foolish, the
weak, to accomplish the most noble purposes&mdash;earthen
vessels, that they might not be too much exalted, least, if they
fall they should get the more injury.&nbsp; God will have all the
glory of a man&rsquo;s salvation, and the power is to be
attributed to him alone, and not to the eloquence or oratory,
learning or piety, gift, or even grace of the speaker; they, as
earthen vessels, are not to be put too low, least they should be
spurned and kicked.&nbsp; God has put an honor on them, and they
are to be honored and esteemed for their work&rsquo;s sake: in
the pulpit they are to know none; but aim at the glory of Christ
and the good of his people&mdash;to keep back nothing that is
profitable&mdash;to conceal no doctrine&mdash;to be ashamed of no
ordinance&mdash;to connive at no error&mdash;to have no
man&rsquo;s person in admiration, but aim at the exaltation of
free, rich grace, in <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the plan of salvation.&nbsp; They are
called earthen vessels, to shew the mighty power of God in their
support, being so weak in themselves; and the protection and
wonderful deliverances of them in times of trouble.&nbsp; Hence
the Apostle, personating them, says, &ldquo;We are troubled on
every side;&rdquo; that is, by every one, saint and sinner; yet
not so distressed as to be without hope or comfort&mdash;We are
perplexed and know not what to do, nor which way to take; but not
in despair of the Lord appearing and working salvation for
us.&mdash;Persecuted, but not forsaken by our God&mdash;Cast down
we sometimes are as an earthen vessel which may be cast out of
man&rsquo;s hand, in order to be dashed to pieces; but not
destroyed&mdash;we are still safe in the hands of Christ, and
kept by the power of God&mdash;and, indeed to what else can all
this be ascribed?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis surprising that earthen
vessels should bear so much, and not fall or be dashed to pieces;
for I think that Ministers have greater trials, greater enemies,
greater sins, and of course, greater sorrows, than any other
believers.&nbsp; The lamp in the pitcher, may be an emblem of
that light which is peculiar to God&rsquo;s Ministers&mdash;not
only the common operations of the Spirit upon them, to constitute
them believers in Jesus, but the light given them for the use of
others&mdash;a greater degree of internal knowledge.&nbsp; Hence
the exhortation, &ldquo;Let your light so shine before men, that
they may see your good works&mdash;<a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Ye are the light of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a knowledge essential to them as
Ministers, and this is not human learning, though that is not to
be despised, but it is the influence of the Spirit upon the mind,
giving them to see, clearer than others, the plan of salvation,
the depravity of human nature, the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
the nature of the law, the glories of the Saviour, the danger of
a form of godliness, without the power; the temptation, subtilty,
and art of the Devil; the vanity of the world; and the dangerous
tendency of all errors.&nbsp; These things ought to be well known
by us as Ministers, that we may contend earnestly for the faith
once delivered to the saints.&nbsp; What the Lord has taught us,
experimentally, that we are to declare&mdash;as we have heard, so
have we seen&mdash;of sin, the law, the Saviour, the world,
Satan, and error.&nbsp; Hence the Apostle John says, &ldquo;that
which we have heard, which we have seen, and our hands have
handled of the word of life; for the life was manifested, and we
have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal
life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto
us.&mdash;That which we have heard and seen declare we unto you,
that ye also may have fellowship with us.&rdquo;&mdash;This lamp,
or light, is manifest by an ability to speak forth what they see
and have been taught.&nbsp; It is given them for the use of the
Church.&nbsp; Hence the Apostle says, &ldquo;A measure of the
Spirit is given to every man to <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>profit withal;&rdquo; every Minister
of the Gospel, for some purpose in the Church; and it is a sad
pity for good men to fall out by the way, seeing God has allotted
every man his peculiar work; and one Minister never can do the
work of another; yet Satan is always setting brother against
brother.&mdash;Some are calculated to alarm, some to warn, some
to comfort, some to open dark mysteries, some to
establish.&mdash;Paul was raised up to plant churches, where the
Gospel had never been before&mdash;Apollos to water, comfort,
establish, and build up those who had been planted.&nbsp;
Ministers differ in their abilities&mdash;some have greater and
some less; but these all worketh that self same Spirit, who
divideth to his Ministers severally as he will, for the
perfecting of the saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ,
till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
of the Son of God.&mdash;This is the design of the Gospel
Ministry.&nbsp; The breaking of these pitchers, that the light
might appear, may be emblematic of the various trials and
heart-breaking circumstances they meet with here below; and the
more they are broken the clearer they shine&mdash;this is true of
all believers, as well as Ministers in general.&mdash;May not the
trumpets be an emblem of their message to God&rsquo;s saints,
which must give a certain sound?&nbsp; How necessary a Minister
should be at a point about his own state.&nbsp; Only observe the
preaching of those who are not&mdash;what legality&mdash;<a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>what ifs and
buts&mdash;what a mixture of felt Law and unfelt
Gospel&mdash;what dealing in terrors of death, hell, and
damnation!&nbsp; How dismal the sound&mdash;how gloomy the
countenance&mdash;how awful and tremendous the language in
prayer, while in such legal bondage.&nbsp; Hence they sometimes
begin with, Most dreadful God!&mdash;Most terrible Jehovah!&nbsp;
How different the ideas and language of a soul in Gospel
liberty&mdash;Blessed Lord&mdash;Gracious Father&mdash;Precious
Immanuel&mdash;Friend of Sinners&mdash;Lord Jesus&mdash;My
Father&mdash;My reconciled covenant, indulgent God.&nbsp; This is
very different from the terrific language of those who are under
the Law, for the Law always genders to bondage.&nbsp; Such men
cannot give a certain sound&mdash;it is a sound of pardon, of
life, of peace, of holiness, of good-will, and covenant-love, and
mercy.&nbsp; We are to preach, and proclaim pardon to rebels,
mercy to the miserable, deliverance to captives, peace to those
who are convinced of their enmity&mdash;the trumpet of God is
sounding abroad the language of mercy&mdash;salvation through
blood; and while this comforts the saints it starves the
hypocrite, confounds the Pharisee, and becomes the savor of death
to all that hate it.&mdash;As the lamp gave light to the
Israelites, and the trumpet was understood by them at the same
time, it confused and over-turned the host of Midian; and sure I
am that a faithful testimony for God and his truth, will never be
out of the <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>consciences of men, whether saints or enemies, in heaven
and hell.&nbsp; Men cannot endure sound doctrine; they hate the
light&mdash;they oppose those who preach it; and the worst term
of reproach they can now load them with, or cast on them, is that
of Antinomian, although those very characters know in their own
souls they are not so.&mdash;But those Ministers that dare to be
faithful to God and truth, are the only men who handle the Law,
lawfully, hold it forth in its true spirituality, and point the
sinner to look to Jesus as the end of it; and who can look
further than the end?&mdash;Fear not, O ye Ministers of my God;
arise! shine on!&mdash;set the trumpet to the
mouth&mdash;proclaim a free-grace Gospel, and leave all
consequences to God.&nbsp; Shine on, ye stars in the hands of
your God!&nbsp; Ye are the light of the world&mdash;take no
notice of the slanders of Legalists, moderate Divines, Arminians,
Baxterians, Arians, Deists, and Socinians.&nbsp; By your
preaching, praying, and living, shew that one is your master,
even Jesus!&mdash;Permit me to introduce an Eastern Fable, as it
is calculated to illustrate this point: &ldquo;The Owls and Bats
once joined in a petition to Jupiter, against the Sun; humbly
shewing, that his beams were so troublesome that they could not
fly abroad, for at least twelve hours out of the
twenty-four.&nbsp; Jupiter seeing Ph&oelig;bus shortly after,
informed him of the petition he had received, adding, I shall,
however, take no notice <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of the petition; and be it your
business to revenge yourself, by shining.&rdquo;&nbsp; You that
preach the Gospel, &ldquo;go, and do thou likewise:&rdquo;&nbsp;
Suppress no truth&mdash;keep back no part of the price, through
the fear of men, or to procure the favor of men.&nbsp; Be bold
for truth&mdash;the blood of souls stains deep!&nbsp; Remember
the Apostle&rsquo;s language, &ldquo;Woe is me, if I preach not
the Gospel&mdash;yea, woe is me, if I preach not the
Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly.&mdash;May not the pitcher, lamp, and trumpet, be an
emblem of God&rsquo;s saints, the teachings of the Spirit, and
the happy consequence of the same?&mdash;The earthen pitcher may
be figurative of our bodies&mdash;although, through grace, they
are the temples of the Holy-Ghost, yet they are of the earth,
earthy: the body is called an earthly house, because it is from
the earth, is supported by earthly things, has its present abode
on the earth, and will quickly return to it&mdash;the first man
was of the earth, earthy&mdash;so are all his
descendents&mdash;this shews how frail we are, and how little
reason to be proud of ourselves, seeing we came from the dust,
and must return to it.&nbsp; Man was formed out of the
earth&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground;&rdquo;&mdash;the word there used signifies Red
earth.&mdash;Josephus says, that the first man was called Adam,
which in the Hebrew tongue signifies Red; because he was made out
of Red earth&mdash;for such, he says, is the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>true and
virgin earth.&nbsp; Man, in consequence of the Fall, was doomed
to return to it again&mdash;his sin and fall had such an awful
influence, as to make himself and posterity sensual, earthly, and
devilish&mdash;to mind, affect, and cleave to earthly
things&mdash;this is bearing the image of the earthy.&nbsp; But
it hath pleased God our Saviour to confer an honor upon our
nature, by taking it into personal union with his Godhead; and
his mysterious assumption of human nature is, indeed, the wonder
of heaven.&nbsp; Here was heaven and earth joined
together&mdash;God and Man&mdash;but how this was done we cannot
form any idea; even Solomon, with all the wisdom God gave him,
declares of Four things, they were too wonderful for him; and
this subject was one of them, &ldquo;The way of a man with a
maid;&rdquo; or, as Mr. Romaine says, it is in the original,
&ldquo;The way of the Almighty in the virgin, when he took part
of the children&rsquo;s flesh and blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; By earth is
meant the people of God, as creatures; hence the promise,
&ldquo;He shall smite earth with his rod:&rdquo; this is done
when the word comes home with power to the heart.&mdash;Again,
&ldquo;O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the
Lord&mdash;Give ear, O heavens, hear, O earth the words of my
mouth&mdash;I will hear the heavens; they shall hear the earth;
and the earth shall hear the corn, the wine, and the
oil;&rdquo;&mdash;which is a gracious promise of assurance, taken
in these threes declarations, &ldquo;Yea I have loved <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>thee, I have
redeemed thee, I have called thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of these
bodies being so brittle, makes Infidels, Pharisees, and
Hypocrites tremble&mdash;but the believer rejoices in the sweet
thought, that this house cannot last very long, that it will soon
be dissolved or taken down by death; then he will bid a lasting
adieu to sin, his greatest grief.&nbsp; What a contrast between
the child of God and the man of the world!&mdash;while the latter
mournfully exclaims on his dying bed, with a wretched old
Cardinal, &ldquo;Farewell, a long farewell to all my
greatness!&rdquo; the believer can look on this world, and say,
Farewell, a long farewell to all my littleness.&mdash;But this
earthen pitcher, these bodies, are the vessels of mercy, afore
prepared unto glory, and ordained for it.&nbsp; These earthen
pitchers were redeemed from actual as well as original guilt, by
our Redeemer, our kinsman.&nbsp; These vessels, although broke to
pieces by death, will be raised glorious bodies, fit to hold all
the glory our God has in reversion for it&mdash;when they will be
formed like the glorious body of Jesus&mdash;from the loins
upward, to the loins downward, of the colour of amber, and be for
ever with the Lord.&nbsp; The body will be now for the Lord, and
the Lord for the body&mdash;the Apostle calls them the temples of
the Holy-Ghost, because he has taken possession of their
souls&mdash;by his gracious inhabitation he has made them new
creatures, a new creation, a new, a hidden man <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>of the
heart.&nbsp; This was shadowed forth by the light, or lamp in the
pitcher.&nbsp; God is light; and this new man is the seed, or
child of light: this was not formed by piece-meal, but done at
once.&nbsp; When God comes to his temple his train is sure to
fill it&mdash;his train of divine excellencies&mdash;so that when
the Spirit takes the sinner&rsquo;s heart, he brings all his
graces with him; and these are called light, marvellous
light&mdash;Christ formed in the heart the hope of glory, and the
salvation of the soul in the pardon of sin, is called a lamp;
this is the lamp the wise virgins took, while the foolish ones
took the Law&mdash;the one went out in obscure darkness, and left
them under the curse! while the other shone brighter to perfect
day.&mdash;The word of God is compared to light&mdash;this makes
us wise to salvation, as it opens to us what we, as poor sinners
want&mdash;the knowledge of God reconciled and well pleased with
us in Christ&mdash;Thus &ldquo;the entrance of thy word giveth
light, it giveth understanding to the simple.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
light of God&rsquo;s countenance upon the soul is a precious lamp
in this pitcher, which is nothing more than the Spirit of God
operating as a Comforter, and sweetly assuring the heart of its
pardon; while peace is enjoyed, and we can look God in the face
with pleasure, and say, My Father!&mdash;May not the trumpet be a
figure of the testimony that all the saints bear to the freeness
of divine <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>grace&mdash;to the sovereignty, power and faithfulness
of a covenant God, in a gracious experience of these things,
&ldquo;Come hither, all ye that fear God, I will tell you what he
hath done for my soul.&rdquo;&mdash;This is proclaiming the glory
of God&mdash;they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great
goodness; they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk
of thy power.&nbsp; Thus when we are called out of darkness, and
experience the light of the Son of God&mdash;we plead our
master&rsquo;s cause&mdash;when we are helped to walk
consistently with our holy profession, this is the trumpet we
sound&mdash;God is faithful&mdash;By grace are we saved&mdash;He
hath, from the beginning, chosen us to salvation&mdash;We are
bought with a price&mdash;He hath remembered us when in our low
estate&mdash;He brought me out of the horrible pit.&nbsp; We
likewise give invitations to others&mdash;they took knowledge of
the men, that they had been with Jesus&mdash;&ldquo;Come, see a
man that told me all that ever I did.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we meet
with a soul in trouble, we sound the trumpet, as those did, of
old, to the blind man&mdash;&ldquo;And they call the blind man,
saying unto him, Be of good comfort; rise! he calleth
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; We relate what great things he has done to us;
and like the Gadarene, &ldquo;Go, and proclaim how Jesus met with
us&mdash;cast out the Devil&mdash;clothed us and made us
wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Jesus gets the glory of our salvation; so
by a close adherence to his Gospel, we bear our testimony <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>against a
form of godliness without the power.&mdash;Nor can we be easy
without letting others know what state they are in that are
cleaving to the Law.&nbsp; We must be faithful if we fall into
company with the enemies of Jesus, the Deist, the Arian, the
Socinian, or any other characters that oppose his Person and
Work.&nbsp; We must openly profess his name and
salvation&mdash;and having a gracious experience of the truth, we
are not easy moved by those adversaries, who are ripening
themselves for damnation, by opposing the dear
Redeemer&mdash;this is the case with some thousands this day in
Great Britain.&nbsp; What a mercy to have the truth in the heart;
for though a child of God may not be able to answer all the
sophisticated arguments of the Arian or Socinian, yet he has got
the truth in his soul, which none can dispute him out of; and it
is for want of this that many, who have for a time appeared to
run well, have got into company with such characters, who first
stumbled at the Gospel, then fell into the ditch, from whence
they very seldom come out.&mdash;Here we must sound the trumpet,
and tell all such that if they die in that state, where God is
they never can come.&mdash;What a mercy to have the light of
life&mdash;to be taught of God&mdash;to know the plague of the
heart&mdash;the vanity of the world&mdash;the weakness of our own
arm&mdash;the value of the atonement&mdash;to be built up and
established in our souls&mdash;and to long for the glorious
appearing of <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>the great God our Saviour.&nbsp; Whatsoever maketh
manifest is light&mdash;God is the Lord, who hath shewed us the
light.&nbsp; This is not mere head knowledge; but what is written
in the Scriptures of truth is written in our hearts, by the
Spirit&mdash;&ldquo;I will put my law in their hearts&mdash;they
shall all know me, from the least to the greatest, for I will be
merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins will I remember
no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; A light to see this truth in the Bible, and
the Spirit bearing witness to our souls that this is our
privilege and blessing, is an unspeakable mercy; &rsquo;tis this
disarms death of its sting&mdash;&rsquo;tis this smooths the
rugged path of life&mdash;sweetens every sorrow&mdash;lightens
every burthen, and gives a rest to the soul&mdash;makes our faces
to shine, and comforts the soul in every
tribulation&mdash;&rsquo;tis this makes a sick bed easy, and bows
the will to God&rsquo;s&mdash;removes the fears of death, and
gives an easy passage to glory.&nbsp; Oh, its a blessed thing to
have true light to see the Person and Work of Jesus, as our
atoning sacrifice, and end of the Law for righteousness: this
fills the soul with joy&mdash;this inspires the mind with a song
of praise through life, and in a dying hour will swell louder,
Salvation to God and the Lamb.</p>
<p>But there is one part of this history must not be
overlooked&mdash;the pitchers were broken before the light could
well be seen, or any victory gained.&nbsp; <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Every man, by
nature, is represented as whole; but when the Holy Spirit
operates upon the soul, it is broken to pieces, that the light
may appear.&nbsp; The language and complaint of Job, is doubtless
the experience of every one taught of God&mdash;&ldquo;I was at
ease, but he hath taken me by the neck, shaken me to pieces, and
set me up for his mark;&rdquo; and surely if the Prodigal Son had
never been broken in pieces, by a sense of want, he would not
have longed for his father&rsquo;s house.&mdash;By the light the
Israelites got the victory; and it is only by the light of the
Spirit we get a victory over the blindness of our hearts&mdash;by
a discovery of the obedience of Jesus, we get the victory over
the Law&mdash;the Spirit demonstrating to our hearts, that by
him, all that believe are justified from all things from which
they could not be justified by the Law of Moses.&mdash;By a
discovery of the sufferings and death of Jesus, we overcome all
our guilt, original and actual&mdash;while faith receives the
atonement, and hears the glad tidings, &ldquo;I, even I, am he
that blotteth out all thy transgression.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
received, embraced, and relied upon, will overcome all guilt,
depravity, and misery&mdash;&ldquo;They overcame by the blood of
the Lamb;&rdquo;&mdash;this is a receipt in full of all demands;
so that whatever the Law or conscience says, our advocate steps
in, and shews his hands and his side&mdash;this is enough for
us.&mdash;By this same light we see in God&rsquo;s word, the
wonderous plan of salvation&mdash;<a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>the stability of the
covenant&mdash;the eternity of God&rsquo;s love&mdash;the Person
of Jesus, as our representative in heaven for us&mdash;with many
precious promises, and God&rsquo;s faithfulness to them.&nbsp;
This brings comfort into the mind, overcomes our fear, and bears
us up in trouble.&nbsp; When Satan is permitted to harrass the
mind, by insinuating the probability of our fall into awful
errors, we can answer, it is written, &ldquo;He shall guide into
all truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we overcome by the word of our
testimony.&mdash;But as it was necessary the pitchers should be
broken, that the light appear, and our Lord Jesus is called the
breaker&mdash;so, by his Spirit&rsquo;s gracious teaching we are
broke off from the world&mdash;&ldquo;Come out from among
them.&rdquo;&mdash;We are broke from a form of
Godliness&mdash;from false views of God, and often from the
esteem of the world&mdash;from trusting in the Law&mdash;from our
own righteousness&mdash;and from carnal professors, who have only
a name to live, while they are dead!&nbsp; So we are broke in
pieces with a sense of guilt, with groaning under the wrath of
God, the fears of death, the curse of the Law, and the bondage we
feel.&nbsp; God approves of this, as the effect of the work of
his own Spirit&mdash;&ldquo;a broken and a contrite heart, O God
thou wilt not despise;&rdquo;&mdash;thou hast sore broken us in
the place of Dragons.&mdash;When peace is proclaimed to the soul,
and we are led to see Jesus as a man of sorrows, and acquainted
with grief.&nbsp; When the matter becomes <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>personal, and
we can say, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere you my sins, my cruel sins, his
chief tormentors were!&rdquo;&mdash;this lays the sinner low,
while his heart is dissolved in tears, and love, and
blood&mdash;&ldquo;They shall look on him whom they have pierced,
and mourn.&rdquo;&mdash;When our souls are led to reflect on our
sins and daily infirmities, with the long-suffering of God to us,
the mercy and truth he hath shewn us, the way he hath led us, the
great things he has done for us, the deliverances he has wrought,
the prayers he has answered, the appearances we have had of his
faithfulness and love&mdash;these things melt the heart, overcome
the soul, lay us in the dust, and create the most delightful
thoughts of Jesus, so that we can give him the glory due to his
name.&mdash;Here the Lord overcomes all our evil with good, and
fulfils this promise, &ldquo;They shall loathe themselves in
their own sight, for their iniquities, when I am pacified towards
them, saith the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;Thus the light the Lord has
given us appears in the above manner&mdash;life, faith, hope,
love, repentance, godly sorrow, the fear of God, and Bible
humility&mdash;these implanted in the mind by the Spirit&rsquo;s
gracious inhabitation, are clearly seen by us at times, and,
perhaps, always by others.&nbsp; This light appears conspicuous
in ministers and saints in general, by the various trials with
which they are exercised.&nbsp; Whatever graces or light the Holy
Ghost is pleased to communicate to us is sure to be
tried&mdash;&ldquo;the Lord <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>trieth the righteous;&rdquo; hence
Job says, &ldquo;When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as
gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those very afflictions and trials that drive
the hypocrite from his profession, make the saint shine
brighter.&nbsp; St. Peter encourages believers under their
trials, with this&mdash;&ldquo;Beloved, think it not strange
concerning the fiery trials which are to try
you;&rdquo;&mdash;remember they were all ordered in the Covenant,
in number, weight, and measure; and while they break you off from
an arm of flesh, from the world and self, they try your graces,
and make them appear clear to yourself&mdash;thus God promises,
&ldquo;And thine age (or spiritual birth) shall be clearer than
the noon day; thou shalt shine forth and be as the
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afflictions are not to destroy but to try
us, just as silver and gold are tried in the fire, lose their
dross, and become purer and brighter.&nbsp; Faith is tried, and
becomes more precious than gold which perisheth.&nbsp; Hope of
eternal life is tried, and grows more strong and lively, sure and
stedfast, amidst the greatest storms.&nbsp; Love to Jesus, his
word, ministers, and people, is often tried&mdash;by the trial it
appears that nothing can separate the saint and his
beloved.&nbsp; Patience is tried in afflictions&mdash;humility,
meekness, and every other grace.&nbsp; But in all times of
tribulation, though the outward man, or pitcher decays, yet the
inward man is renewed, day by day.&mdash;How needful the cross,
to keep us humble&mdash;dependent&mdash;wean us from <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the
world&mdash;furnish us with many petitions to God, and make us
long for glory.&nbsp; How sweet are those lines of the excellent
Watts&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Had but the prison wall been strong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And firm, without a flaw,<br />
My soul had long in darkness dwelt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And less of glory saw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reproach from the world, or church, though it breaks the
heart, makes us prize a name and a place in the covenant of
redemption.&nbsp; Persecution, for imputed righteousness&rsquo;
sake, tries our profession and principles, and gives an occasion
to rejoice in the honor of suffering for Christ&rsquo;s
sake.&mdash;A body of sin and death, called the plague of the
heart, tries our hope, and helps us to prize the blood of Jesus
more and more.&mdash;Pain of body&mdash;delays of answer to
prayer, try our patience.&mdash;False doctrines in the world, try
our love; while the devil&rsquo;s fiery darts of blasphemous
thoughts, often try our faith&mdash;thus as our earthen vessels
break, the light appears; and we often shout victory, through the
atonement and righteousness of Jesus, and by the faithfulness of
God.&mdash;This light appears in the whole of their conduct, as
external evidences of an internal work&mdash;in their love to,
and zeal for the truth as it is in Jesus&mdash;in their unfeigned
love to the brethren, as they stand manifest in each
other&rsquo;s consciences that they are called by grace&mdash;in
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>their just
dealings with each other, and the world at large&mdash;&ldquo;the
Lord bless thee, O habitation of justice, O mountain of
holiness.&rdquo;&mdash;In their integrity, uprightness,
affection, and sincerity, at home and abroad, they are to shine
as lights, in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation.&mdash;In allegiance and obedience to the higher
powers&mdash;knowing the powers that be, are ordained of
God.&nbsp; A christian may and ought to be a good subject, under
any government&mdash;&ldquo;Fear God, honor the king,&rdquo; is
the command of the Holy-Ghost&mdash;that whereas the world speaks
against you, as evil doers, they may, by your conversation which
they shall behold, glorify God, in the day of visitation.&nbsp;
The grace of God makes men good fathers, good masters, good
subjects, and honest tradesmen.&mdash;Believer, take care that
you show to the world and the church, what great things God has
done for you, by having your conduct squared according to the
precepts of the New Testament, which is to be the rule of your
actions; and as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on
them, and mercy.&nbsp; Thus the light appears, and you proclaim
to all around, that you have been with Jesus, and learned of
him.&nbsp; And while the Pharisees condemn you as an Antinomian
in principle, shew them that your high principles are heavenly
ones, by the effects produced&mdash;take the New Testament for
your rule of conduct, and then fear not.&mdash;This light appears
in a steady, <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>uniform, constant attendance on all the ordinances of
God&rsquo;s appointment&mdash;prayer, private and
public&mdash;hearing those ministers that exalt the Saviour in
every sermon&mdash;a submission to the ordinance of baptism, by
immersion, as soon as it appears to them right&mdash;an attention
to the Lord&rsquo;s supper, from a principle of love to
Jesus&mdash;godly conversation with the most experimental
christians.&nbsp; Here the light is seen: I mention these things
because many of my adversaries have circulated it, far and near,
that I am an Antinomian, and deny all practical
religion!&mdash;When will mankind forbear lying against each
other; and those who contend for the Law, keep the ninth
commandment as they ought to do?&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally.&mdash;Soon will the earthen pitcher be broke by
death! then the soul enlightened, will enter into perfect
day&mdash;see as it is seen&mdash;know as it is known.&nbsp; The
blessed Spirit, in the article of death, will be poured out upon
the soul, to fit her for her passage.&nbsp; Hence he is promised,
as the early and as the latter rain&mdash;a greater light comes
into the soul, as it is about to depart into the regions of
endless light&mdash;in the light of faith the departing soul sees
the pardon of sin, the obedience of Jesus its own&mdash;sees
heaven open&mdash;angels ready waiting, and whispering to the
saint, The master is come, and calleth for thee! while <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the saint
exclaims, Come, Lord Jesus! come quickly!&mdash;thus he enters
into rest, while Jesus is his everlasting light, his god and
glory.&mdash;I close this Sermon, in the language of Dr.
Watts&rsquo; Description of a Saint&rsquo;s Life and Death, under
the fine emblem of a Summer&rsquo;s Day and Setting Sun.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just so the Christian, his race he
begins&mdash;<br />
He melts into tears when he mourns for his sins;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And travels his heavenly way.<br
/>
But as he draws nearer to finish his race,<br />
Like a fine setting sun, he looks richer in grace,<br />
And gives a sure hope at the end of his days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of rising in brighter array.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may God grant to us all.&mdash;AMEN.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
